# OrgoVision ðŸ”¬

OrgoVision is a powerful desktop application designed to identify and classify organ images using advanced machine learning techniques. Built with Python and TensorFlow, it provides medical professionals and researchers with a user-friendly interface for quick and accurate organ recognition.

## UI Overview

The OrgoVision UI is designed to be simple and intuitive, featuring easy-to-navigate buttons and real-time feedback. Users can quickly upload images, view predictions, and access detailed confidence metrics in a clean interface.

Below is a sample screenshot of the UI:



## Features

- **Real-time Image Analysis**: Upload and analyze organ images instantly
- **High-Precision Recognition**: Powered by a fine-tuned LeNet architecture
- **Confidence Scoring**: Get detailed confidence metrics for each prediction
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for seamless operation
- **Multi-format Support**: Compatible with common image formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You'll need the following packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orgovision.git
cd orgovision
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Saving Model Weights Before Running the App

Before launching OrgoVision, ensure you have saved the model weights properly. Follow these steps to save the weights:

1. Open the `Classify.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells that train or load the model.
3. Use the following command to save the weights:

   ```python
   model.save_weights('models/orgovision_weights.h5')
   ```

   Ensure the `models/` directory exists or create it using:

   ```bash
   mkdir models
   ```

4. Verify that the `orgovision_weights.h5` file is present in the `models/` directory.

Once the weights are saved, you can proceed to run the app.



1. Launch OrgoVision by running the imports cell and then run the last cell   # responsible for the UI
2. Click "Upload Image" to select an organ image
3. Wait for the analysis to complete
4. View the prediction results and confidence score

The application will display:

- Predicted organ type
- Confidence percentage
- Original image with automatic scaling

## Development Setup

If you're looking to contribute or modify OrgoVision, here's what you'll need:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Model Information

OrgoVision uses a modified LeNet architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of organ images. The model achieves:

- 95% accuracy on validation data
- Fast inference time (<2s per image)
- Support for 10+ organ classifications

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Image Won't Load?**

- Check if the image format is supported (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted
- Verify you have read permissions for the file

**Slow Performance?**

- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Check if your GPU drivers are up to date
- Ensure you have sufficient RAM available
